# pipewalker

porting of Pipewalker to web interface (my AI project in ITB).
this is my personal project for final term in "Artificial Intelligent" in ITB (master degree).
I made this for implement AI algorithm in my final term.

- ported by : ryan hs &lt;mr.ryansilalahi@gmail.com&gt;

### install notes
- just use bower to install bootstrap-sass and jquery
- i use koala to compile style.scss, you can use other apps if you like


### AI implementation in C
if you want to learn some basic AI in C, you can checkout into branch dev to see AI directory,
but since this github host can't run server side apps, then i made a sample AI in javascript for gh-pages :-)
